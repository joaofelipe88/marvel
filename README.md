## *The Architecuture*


We will use  **VIPER** in this project. 

**VIPER** is an Clean Architecture to iOS apps. 
The word VIPER means **View**, **Interactor**, **Presenter**, **Entity**, and **Routing**. 
This clean architecture will split an logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. Becoming easier to test the interactions between the layers and to isolate dependencies as your database, for example.
